# ofxGMM

gaussian mixture model for openframeworks based on [this code](https://github.com/luxiaoxun/GMM).

can train a GMM by giving it data points, or can set the GMM explicitly by giving it a set of Gaussians (prior, mean, variance).

once there is a GMM set, you can sample random points from it, or obtain the probability of a given point.  

included example shows how to use it.
